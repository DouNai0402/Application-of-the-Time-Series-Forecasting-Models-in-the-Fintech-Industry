# Application-of-the-Time-Series-Forecasting-Models-in-the-Fintech-Industry

The study contains two series of experiment.
First experiment: Use LSTM to predict single-day stock prices of four ETFs (SPY, BND, GLD AND VIOO).
Second experiment: Compare the predictive performance of Long-sequence Time Forecasting task
	between Informer and vanilla LSTM.

There are two models included in this project:
	1. 'LSTM for Fintech Prediction':The LSTM model used for  single-day stock price and LSTF task.
	2. 'Informer for Fintech Prediction':The Informer used for multi-day stock price task.
	Both models are programmed by Python

The datasets are contained in each Python project.
